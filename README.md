# sas_dbr_demo

A demonstration on how to work with *SAS* in *Databricks* using the *SASPy* module. It contains two Databricks notebooks:

* Classy Cars - shows the application of analytical tools in *SAS*, *Python* and *R* and transfer between the respective environments using two well known datasets: *SAS*' `sashelp.class` data set and *R*'s `mtcars` data frame.
* Unicode Fractions - demonstrates the correct processing of *Unicode* characters in *SAS* when being transfered from *Python* via Pandas.
